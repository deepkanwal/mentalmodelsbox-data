  We can explore a theory by imagining an experiment for it and thinking through
  its potential consequences.
description: >
  A thought experiments is a technique used to explore a hypothesis, theory or
  principle by thinking through what its consequences would be. These
  experiments are not actually performed and are often impossible to set up. The
  intent is not to prove something, but rather to explore difficult questions
  through speculation and logical thinking. Hopefully, the results of this
  thinking will lead us down interesting paths we might otherwise miss. Some
  examples are: "What will happen if this event occurs?", "If B happened instead
  of A, how might things differ?", "If something happens in the future, what
  might cause it?".

    Einstein imagined what would happen if someone chased a light beam and
    caught up. The results of this thought experiment lead him to special
    relativity. Note that this experiment was not actually performed and the
    theory was proven using other empirical means.

    The [trolly problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) is a
    famous thought experiment in the field of ethics. It's often referenced with
    thinking about the design of self-driving cars.
