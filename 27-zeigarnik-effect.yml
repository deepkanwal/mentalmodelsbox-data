description: >
  The Zeigarnik Effect is a psychological phenomenon that suggests people
  remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. Named
  after Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, who first studied the phenomenon,
  it implies that incomplete tasks create a kind of mental tension that
  improves recall. This can be applied in various fields, such as education and
  project management, to enhance productivity and learning by structuring tasks
  and breaks effectively.
examples:
  - >
    Students are more likely to remember the contents of a study session if they
     take a break in the middle, leaving some material unfinished until they
    return.
  - >
    Cliffhangers in TV shows and books exploit the Zeigarnik Effect by leaving
    the audience eagerly anticipating the resolution in future episodes or
    chapters.
