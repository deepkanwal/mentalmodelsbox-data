oneliner: >
  In productive processes, the value gained from increasing one input but
  keeping others the same will at some point start decreasing.
description: >
  When producing something, there are inputs and results. The law of diminishing
  returns states that simply increasing one input but keeping others the same
  will at some point yield diminishing results.  In some cases, this can be
  improved by adjusting other inputs appropriately. For example, if adding more
  workers to a factory, we can also add more machines and working space. In
  other cases, the production may be inherently difficult to parallelize.

    [Brookâ€™s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) states that just
    increasing headcount in a software project, will not make it ship faster.
    Ramp-up time, communication overhead, and the indivisibility of certain
    tasks may in fact slow it down.

    In our personal lives, we may find that doing too much of something may lead
    to diminishing (or even negative) returns. For instance, over editing a
    piece of writing or continuing to tweak a painting.
