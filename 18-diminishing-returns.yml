name: Diminishing Returns
oneliner: >
  In productive processes, the value gained from adding a resource will
  eventually start decreasing.
description: >
  When producing something, there are inputs and results. The law of diminishing
  returns states that simply increasing one input but keeping others the same
  will at some point yield diminishing results.  In some cases, this can be
  improved by adjusting other inputs appropriately (e.g. if increasing factory
  workers, also add more machines and increase factory space) but in other
  cases, the production may be inherently difficult to parallelize.

    [Brookâ€™s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) states that just
    increasing headcount in a software project, will not make it ship faster.
    Ramp-up time, communication overhead, and the indivisibility of certain
    tasks may in fact slow it down.

    When working on a business that's not picking up any traction, we may feel
    obligated to continue due to amount of time and money we've poured into it.
    That effort is a sunk cost, future decisions regarding the business should
    ignore it. See also: [escalation of
