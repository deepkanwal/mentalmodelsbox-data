name: Gambler's Fallacy
oneliner: >
  The mistaken belief that a random event is more or less likely to occur based
  on past outcomes.
description: >
  Past occurrences of an independent random event have no impact of future
  occurrences. For instance, the probability of getting heads in a coin toss is
  1/2 regardless of the previous tosses. If we encounter a dozen heads in a row,
  we may feel that the next toss will be tails to balance things out. This is a
  mistaken belief--the probability of tails remains 1/2, the same as in previous
  tosses.

    A game of roulette at Monte Carlo Casino on August 18, 1913 is perhaps the
    most iconic example of the fallacy. The ball fell in the black 26 times in a
    row causing gamblers to lose millions in the mistaken belief that the
    probability of red was now higher.
