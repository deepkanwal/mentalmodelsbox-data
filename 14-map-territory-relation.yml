  While models are useful in explaining reality, they are not reality itself.
description: >
  Often described as "the map is not the territory", this mental model refers to
  the relationship between an object and a representation of that object. A map
  is an abstraction and imperfect representation of a territory--it is not the
  territory itself. Abstractions are a necessary step in simplifying the
  complexities of reality. After all, imagine how difficult it'd be to drive in
  an unknown area without a map. However, we should be aware that these
  abstractions have limitations and are created using assumptions that may not
  always be true. This applies to mental models as well--while useful in
  explaining common situations, reality is not bound to conform to these models.

    Newton's laws of motion are a model explaining physical phenomena. While an
    excellent approximation for most cases, these laws do not hold when working
    at very small scales, at very high speeds, or in very strong gravitation
    fields. These cases require different models.

    [The Treachery of
    Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images) is a famous
    painting of a pipe with a caption stating this is not a pipe. In describing
    it, painter RenÃ© Magritte said, "...could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a
    representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture 'This is a
    pipe', I'd have been lying!"

    [This classic clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOW_kPzY_JY) from The
    Office of Michael Scott driving into a lake is a literal example of the map
    not being the territory.
