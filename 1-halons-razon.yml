name: Hanlon's Razor
oneliner: >
  Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
description: >
  Hanlon's razor asks for reflection in situations where we perceive behavior 
  to be intentionally malicious. A useful exercise is to rethink the scenario 
  by replacing the malicious intent with reasons such as stupidity, stress or 
  just plain old misunderstanding.
examples: 
  - >
    Your five-year old probably isn't making a mess to make your life miserable 
    but rather because they're a toddler.
  - >
    A social networking website probably didn't flag your content out of malice 
    but rather due to a faulty algorithm.
