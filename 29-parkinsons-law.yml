  Parkinson's Law is the adage that "work expands to fill the time available for
  its completion", suggesting that the duration of a task is dictated by the
  deadline set for it, rather than by the amount of work involved. This concept
  implies that if you give yourself a week to complete a two-hour task, then
  (psychologically speaking)  the task will increase in complexity and become
  more daunting so as to fill that week. It highlights the inefficiencies in
  time management and suggests the importance of setting appropriate deadlines
  to increase productivity.
examples:
  - >
    A student given two weeks to prepare a presentation will likely use the
    entire period, even if the actual work could be completed in a few days.
  - >
    An employee assigned a minor task with a long deadline might over-complicate
     the task, making it more time-consuming than necessary.
