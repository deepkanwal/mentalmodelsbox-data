name: Recency Bias
oneliner: >
  We tend to place greater emphasis on recent events over past ones.
description: >
  Events that have occurred recently tend to be seen as more important than 
  historic events. This is often just because the event is fresh in our memory 
  as opposed to its actual importance. The perceived importance of recent 
  events will likely drop with time. 
examples:
  - >
    Employee reviews are prone to recency bias. The performance of work done 
    most recently will disproportionally impact the final review.

    In Law, the closing argument given by the defence is seen to have an 
    advantage as it's the freshest in the jury's memory.
