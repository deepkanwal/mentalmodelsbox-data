  We tend to place higher value on things that are rare and lower value on
  things that are abundant.
description: >
  Scarcity refers to our tendency to place value on things according to how rare
  they are. It's often used as a mental shortcut to assess the value of
  something based on how easy or difficult is it to acquire. Scarcity doesn't
  just apply to objects--it can also be applied to things like time and
  information. For instance, we might place high value on spending some time
  with a busy individual or getting access to confidential information. Since
  scarcity can increase our desire for something, it's often artificially
  created to sell something. A good strategy to combat this desire is to
  remember that scarcity only increases our desire to obtain something and
  doesn't affect the actual value we'll extract from it.

    Sales techniques likes setting deadlines on promotions or indicating that
    limited quantities are available are designed to drive up scarcity driven
    desire for the item being sold.

    When information is censored, we not only feel a stronger desire to know
    about it and but also tend to be more favorable to it.
