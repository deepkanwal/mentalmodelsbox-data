  More desirable behaviors can be used to reinforce less desirable behaviors.
description: >
  Premack's Principle, often used in psychology, suggests that more desirable
  activities can motivate and reinforce less desirable ones. It's based on the
  idea that if a person wants to do a particular activity, they can use that
  desire as a reward for completing a less appealing task first. This principle
  is especially useful in behavior modification, education, and self-discipline
  strategies, helping individuals or educators to encourage the completion of
  necessary but less appealing tasks by following them with more enjoyable
  activities.
examples:
  - >
    A child who enjoys playing video games can be encouraged to finish homework
    first, using game time as a reward.
  - >
    An employee who loves coffee breaks can use the break as a motivation to
    complete a challenging report.
