  Optimal motivation occurs when tasks are neither too hard nor too easy.
description: >
  The Goldilocks Rule states that maximum engagement and motivation are achieved
  when tasks are at the right level of difficulty - not too easy to be boring,
  but not too hard to be frustrating. This concept is rooted in the
  psychological theory of flow, where a person is fully immersed and focused on
  an activity. The Goldilocks Rule is valuable in personal development,
  education, and workplace productivity, as it helps in designing tasks and
  challenges that keep individuals optimally engaged and motivated, leading to
  better learning, performance, and satisfaction.
