  The feeling that we could have predicted an event after it occurs (i.e. we
  "knew it all along").
description: >
  Hindsight bias is the feeling we get when we perceive an event as being
  predictable, even though there's little evidence to suggest we could have
  predicted it. Once the event has occurred, it's easy to work backwards and
  find explanations. While hindsight bias can result in increased confidence and
  performance, too much can lead to overconfidence and an inability to learn
  from experience. For instance, by assuming that we could have done better than
  others after knowing the results of their actions, we lost an opportunity to
  understand why those actions were made.
examples:

    In court, judgement of a defendant can be clouded by hindsight bias. The
    jury, knowing the outcome of the defendant's actions, might feel as if they
    could have predicted the outcome.

    We may feel that people in the past were less intelligent or innovative than
    those of the present without acknowledging that they did not access to
    present day information. Related: [Historian's
