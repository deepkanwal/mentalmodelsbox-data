oneliner: >
  Discovering the root cause of an event involves looking deeper than the
  immediate causes for that event.
description: >
  A proximate cause is the event most closely associated with or immediately
  responsible for an observed result. This may differ from the root cause.
  Getting to a root cause often requires a deep dive into the situation using
  approaches like [Socratic
  questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning) or the [5
  Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)
examples:

    Post-mortem reports for critical failures generally outline proximate causes
    and how they stem from the root cause. For instance a website was down due
    servers running out of disk space which was in turn a result of a bug which
    in turn was a result of poor testing and so on.

    A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is
    trying to get to the root cause.
