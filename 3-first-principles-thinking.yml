name: First Principles Reasoning
oneliner: >
  Break complex problems into foundational elements and use these elements to
  build your reasoning.
description: >
  A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition that cannot be
  derived from other assumption or propositions. By attempting to break down
  problems into first principles and re-constructing solutions using these
  building blocks, you're less likely to be biased by prior assumptions. This in
  turn can lead to more innovative solutions.
examples:
  - >
    A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is
    intuitively thinking in first principles.
  - >
    A company building a cheaper product than competitors by investigating ways
    of using the raw materials firsthand instead of just following existing
    conventions.
