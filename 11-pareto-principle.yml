name: Pareto Principle
oneliner: >
  For many scenarios, 80% of the effects stem from 20% of the causes. This is
  often referred to as the 80/20 rule.
description: >
  In 1896, economist [Vilfredo
  Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) found that 20% of the
  population in Italy owned 80% of the land. This ratio is commonly cited in
  wealth distribution (the richest 20% owns the majority of the world's income)
  and in business management (80% of sales come from 20% of clients). Another
  application is managing workload--by prioritizing the 20% most important work,
  we can (at times) gain 80% of the value. Note that while the Pareto principle
  can be a useful construct in many situations, it's not applicable everywhere.
