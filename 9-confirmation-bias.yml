  We have a tendency to perceive things in a way that re-enforces or aligns with
  our preexisting beliefs.
description: >
  Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to see things in a way
  that confirms our preexisting beliefs. Because it involves selectively
  collecting and recalling information, the end result is a biased view point.
  In addition, confirmation bias may also cause us to ignore information that
  doesn't support our views. Closely related is the feeling of [cognitive
  dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) which refers
  to the discomfort we feel when holding contradictory beliefs.

    In social media, we're often shown content that we're more likely to agree
    with. This amplifies confirmation bias--we only see things consistent with
    our beliefs resulting a sort of "echo chamber". For more on this, see
    [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble).

    Belief in farfetched conspiracy theories can often be a result of
    confirmation bias. If one tries hard enough, they can find things that seem
    to support the theory while ignoring the evidence that refutes it.
