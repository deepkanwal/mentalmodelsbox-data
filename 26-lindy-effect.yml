  Things that have been around for a while are likely to continue to stick
  around.
description: >
  The Lindy Effect is a theory that suggests the future life expectancy of
  non-perishable things, such as a technology, an idea, or a book, is
  proportional to their current age. This means the longer something
  non-perishable  has been around, the longer it is likely to continue to exist.
  This concept is  often used to discuss the longevity of cultural items or
  technologies,  suggesting that those which have proven their durability over
  time are likely  to remain relevant or in use for an extended period.
examples:
  - >
    Classical works of literature, like those by Shakespeare, having been around
     for centuries, are likely to remain relevant and read for many more years.

    The QWERTY keyboard layout, despite its inefficiencies, has been in use
    since the 19th century and is likely to continue being the standard due to
    its widespread adoption and familiarity.
