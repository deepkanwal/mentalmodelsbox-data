  Referring to oneself in the third person can create psychological distance and
  objectivity.
description: >
  Illeism is the practice of referring to oneself in the third person (e.g.
  they) instead of  the first person (e.g. I). This can be used as a mental
  model to create a psychological distance between the self and one's actions or
  thoughts. By speaking or thinking about oneself as a separate entity, it
  becomes possible to assess personal behaviors, decisions, and characteristics
  more objectively. This detachment can aid in self-reflection, reduce emotional
  bias, and foster clearer, more impartial thinking. It's a technique sometimes
  used in therapeutic settings, leadership development, and by public figures to
  gain unique perspectives on their own actions.
examples:
  - >
    Instead of thinking "I need to improve my work performance," considering
    "John needs to improve his work performance" to gain a clearer perspective
    on the steps to be taken.
  - >
    A public speaker preparing for a presentation might think, "How would the
    audience view Maria's speech?" to refine their approach and content.
