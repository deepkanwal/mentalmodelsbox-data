oneliner: >
  When comparing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be
  selected.
description: >
  Occam's razor originally stated that entities should not be multiplied
  unnecessarily. In other words, don't complicate things when you don't need to.
  By shaving off unnecessary additions, the resulting explanation tends  to be
  less ambiguous, easier to verify, and just plain simpler. Occam's  Razor is
  often mentioned when selecting a simple solution over a complex  one. Note
  that this is a slightly stronger form than the principle  intended--reality
  can be complex and there are cases where the simple  solution is not correct.

    pyramids being built by aliens.
