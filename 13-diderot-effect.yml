oneliner: >
  Obtaining something new can lead us to purchase of additional, complementary
  things that we otherwise wouldn't have.
description: >
  The Diderot effect is named after French philosopher Denis Diderot who, after
  receiving an expensive robe, began a purchasing spree because he felt his
  current possessions felt tawdry in comparison to the robe. The effect consists
  of two ideas. The first is that we purchase things which feel cohesive to our
  sense of identity. These items tend to be complementary. The second is that
  obtaining something that differs from our current possessions can result in a
  desire to obtain goods which complement the new possession (i.e. are
  consistent with this new identity). This can result in a spiraling shopping
  spree.

examples:
  - >
    Moving into an expensive house often leads to the purchase of new furniture
    and household goods even if our old furniture is fine. We feel a desire to
    upgrade our furniture in the same way we've upgraded our house.

    Marketers often attempt to appeal to a desired identify when advertising
    their products. For instance, certain brands are associated with an active /
    health conscious image. We are likely to purchase these items if they appeal
    to our personal sense of identity.
