  We tend to feel obligated to repay positive actions towards us (e.g. favors,
  gifts) even if they are unwanted.

  Reciprocity refers to a social norm in which we feel a sense of obligation
  when receiving positive actions towards us. For instance, receiving a favor or
  gift can trigger feelings of indebtedness to repay the act in someway. While
  reciprocity allows one to build relationships and exchanges, it can be
  exploited to gain someone's compliance to a request. This is because feelings
  of obligation can be felt even when receiving a positive action we do not
  want.
examples:

    Before attempting to sell something, a salesperson may give you a small gift
    (e.g. a pen or a free sample). Even if this gift is unwanted, receiving it
    can still trigger a need to repay the gift, usually in the form of
    purchasing whatever is being sold.

    A common compliance technique is to start by making a large request that's
    likely to be rejected followed by a second, smaller request. The second
    request, which is the intended request, is more likely to be accepted as
    it's seen as a favor.
