name: Sunk Cost Fallacy
oneliner: >
  We have a tendency to continue an endeavor after investing resources into it
  even if it's no longer worthwhile.
description: >
  The sunk cost fallacy describes our resistance to stop an endeavor after
  investing time, money or effort into it. This limits our ability to see its
  worth in present terms and potentially misallocate additional resources on it.
  In other words, we're not cutting our losses. Ideally, we would make decisions
  regarding an endeavor based on relevant information--suck costs are almost
  always irrelevant.

    When selling a used car, the amount originally paid should have not factor
    into the decision to sell it. Rather, the decision to sell the car should be
    based on if the owner will get more value from selling it at the current
    resale price versus keeping it.

    When working on a business that's not picking up any traction, we may feel
    obligated to continue due to amount of time and money we've poured into it.
    That effort is a sunk cost, future decisions regarding the business should
    ignore it. See also: [escalation of
    commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment).

    Leaving in the middle of a sports game might feel like we're wasting the
    money spent on the ticket. However that money has already been spent, it
    should not impact future decisions.
